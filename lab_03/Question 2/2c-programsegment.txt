// 2. c. program SEGMENT only
//
// Question:
//
// Write a program segment to delete the last node
// in the linked list, which is pointed by tail.
// Assume curr point to the node with item equal
// to 10.
//

// assuming we are referring to Figure 7.9 
// BEFORE the execution of the lines in 2. a.

// assume curr point to the node with the item
// equal 10, so since it is pointing to the last
// node, and we are deleting the last node, so
// set it to NULL
curr->link = NULL;

// delete the last node in the linked list
delete tail;
tail = NULL; // set the pointer to point to NULL
